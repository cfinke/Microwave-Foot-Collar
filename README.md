Microwave Foot Collar
---------------------
The problem: my microwave slides around on my countertop, and its feet are so small that double-sided tape doesn't have enough surface area to stop it.

Solution: a collar to place under each microwave feet with enough surface area to use large double-sided carpet tape so that it doesn't slide around the counter.

This will raise the microwave up `$collar_base_thickness` mm. `$collar_inner_diameter` should be set big enough to allow the microwave feet to fit inside of it. `$collar_max_height` should be less than the height of the microwave's existing foot so that the foot reaches the bottom of the collar opening. I'm using 2-inch carpet tape, so I chose a `$collar_outer_diameter` of two inches.
